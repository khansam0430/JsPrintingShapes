# JsPrintingShapes
Printing shapes in console.log

Upon loading the page, an input box will pop up and ask a set of questions.
These questions are looking for integers that once inserted, will make a shape with the width and height of the inputted number.
There are a total of 6 shapes that appear in the console.log once all the userInputs have been entered.
If there is a number that should not be entered, a prompt box will come up again until the correct input is entered.
